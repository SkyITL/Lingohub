## Problem Description

Below you see sentences in English and their translations into the Ngoni language. In fact each English sentence can be translated into Ngoni in more than one way, but only one variant is given here.

### Given 10 Sentence Pairs

### Task:
Each of the Ngoni sentences (11a-c) and (12a-c) contains an error. Translate these sentences into English, explain what the error is in each case, and then correct it, giving for each example four correct sentences in Ngoni that describe the same situation.

## Notes

- Ngoni is a Bantu language of Tanzania
- Each English sentence can have multiple Ngoni translations (word order flexibility)

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Verb Agreement**: Understanding subject and object agreement markers on verbs
2. **Word Order Variation**: Recognizing flexible constituent order
3. **Noun Class System**: Typical Bantu noun class agreement
4. **Error Analysis**: Identifying grammatical violations

## Key Patterns

### Verb Structure:
Ngoni verbs show agreement with both subject and object:
- **Subject markers**: attached to verb
- **Object markers**: attached to verb (for animate/human objects)
- Base structure: (Subject)-(Object)-ROOT-(Tense/Aspect)

### Agreement Markers:
- **a-**: 3rd person singular subject
- **va-**: 3rd person plural subject (class for humans)
- **-m-**: object marker (human singular)
- **-va-**: object marker (human plural)
- **-guli**: "bought" (verb root with tense)

### Word Order:
Bantu languages typically allow flexible word order with:
- SVO as basic order
- OSV, SOV possible with agreement marking
- Postverbal benefactive constructions

### Noun Classes:
- **m-** prefix: singular human (class 1)
- **va-** prefix: plural human (class 2)
- **m-** prefix: singular object (class 3)
- Various other classes for inanimates

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Fifth (final) problem position
- Requires discovering agreement system from limited data
- Error detection and correction task
- 20 marks (standard weight)
- Must generate multiple correct variants
- Bantu noun class system adds complexity
- Word order permutations challenging
