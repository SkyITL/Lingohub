## Problem Description

Sentences in Adyghe written in simplified romanization with English translations. The sentences involve spatial relationships using verbs of placement (put, throw, drop) and locatives (in/into, under, onto).

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Offer more precise translations of sentences 6 and 7 (even if they don't sound quite so natural in English)
- **Assignment 2**: Translate into English (2 sentences)
- **Assignment 3**: Translate into Adyghe (3 sentences)
- **Assignment 4**: Translate into Adyghe in all possible ways: "Where does he put the table?"

## Notes

- Consonants: **ć**, **ź**, **ḱ**, **w**, **ś**, **ḱ**, **ž**, **ǯ**, **ṗ** are specific consonants
- **ə** and **y** are vowels of the Adyghe language
- Simplified romanization used (not full phonetic transcription)

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Spatial Case System**: Different cases for locations (in, on, under, etc.)
2. **Verb Semantics**: Distinctions between put/drop/throw verbs
3. **Directional Morphology**: Motion into vs. location at
4. **Question Formation**: How spatial questions are formed
5. **Multiple Possibilities**: Assignment 4 reveals systematic ambiguities

## Key Patterns

### Spatial Semantics:
- **Verbs**: put, throw, drop (manner of placement)
- **Locations**: stove, plate, chest, table, stool, kettle, cauldron
- **Spatial Relations**: into, onto, under

### Expected Morphology:
- Case suffixes for different spatial relationships
- Directional markers (toward vs. at location)
- Verb stems with incorporation or agreement
- Possibly noun class or agreement features

### Assignment 4 Insight:
"In all possible ways" suggests:
- Multiple valid case forms for "table" depending on interpretation
- Or multiple valid question constructions
- Reveals systematic patterns in the spatial system

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Northwest Caucasian languages have complex morphology
- Spatial case systems unfamiliar to most learners
- Multiple interacting variables (verb type, location, direction)
- Assignment 4 requires understanding systematic ambiguities
- 20 marks suggests moderate difficulty
- Limited vocabulary helps constrain problem
- Clear semantic domain (spatial relations)
