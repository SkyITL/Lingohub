## Problem Description

In 1916 the Russian scholar Jacob Linzbach invented a universal writing system, which he thought should be understandable to all people, regardless of their native tongue. Linzbach called his new language "Transcendental Algebra".

Several sentences have been written in Linzbach's language and translated into English.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Translate 4 sentences from Transcendental Algebra into English
- **Assignment 2**: Write 4 English sentences in Transcendental Algebra
- Explain your solution

## Notes

- The writing system uses symbolic/logographic notation
- Symbols represent concepts rather than sounds
- Created as a universal language understandable to all people
- Sentences use mathematical-like notation with special symbols

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Symbol-Meaning Correspondence**: Mapping abstract symbols to semantic concepts
2. **Universal Language Concepts**: Understanding constructed language principles
3. **Logical Structure**: Recognizing systematic patterns in symbol combinations
4. **Decipherment Skills**: Inferring rules from limited data

## Key Patterns

### Symbol System:
- Linzbach used abstract symbols to represent grammatical and semantic concepts
- Symbols combine in systematic ways (similar to mathematical notation)
- Word order and symbol arrangement encode grammatical relationships

### Expected Patterns:
- Subject-verb-object relationships encoded symbolically
- Negation markers
- Tense/aspect markers
- Person/number agreement symbols
- Kinship terms and relationships

### Semantic Categories:
From given sentences:
- Family relationships (father, brother, orphan, widow, dwarf, giant, parents)
- Actions (talking, working, writing, liking)
- States (hurry, wicked)
- Abstract concepts (haste, about)

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner

**Reasoning**:
- First problem in first IOL - designed as accessible introduction
- Limited vocabulary and grammatical structures
- Pattern recognition straightforward once system understood
- Universal language concept easier than natural language complexity
- 20 marks (moderate weight for beginner problem)
- Clear one-to-one symbol correspondences
