## Notes

- **j** and **y** are specific consonants of Yoruba
- **ɛ** and **ɔ** are specific vowels of Yoruba (similar to *e* and *o*, respectively)
- The marks **«`»** and **«´»** indicate tones (a higher or lower level of the voice during pronunciation of the syllable)
- **«`»** = low tone
- **«´»** = high tone
- Mid tone is unmarked

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Possessive Construction Analysis**: Understanding N1 N2 → "N2's N1" or "N1 of N2"
2. **Tone Sandhi**: How tones change in different syntactic contexts
3. **Word Order**: Yoruba uses possessed-possessor order
4. **Tonal Morphology**: How tone patterns indicate grammatical relationships

## Key Patterns

### Possessive Structure:
Yoruba possessive constructions follow the pattern:
- **[Possessed] [Possessor]** = "Possessor's Possessed" or "Possessed of Possessor"
- Example: **igi ìyǎ** = tree mother = "mother's tree"

### Vocabulary (deduced):
- **ajɔ/ajā** = dog
- **ɔkɔ/òkɔ̀** = husband
- **ìlé/olé** = house
- **elu/èlù** = stranger/city
- **igi/egi** = tree
- **ìyǎ/òyǎ** = mother
- **ɔka** = husband (variant)
- **àjɛ́** = witch
- **ìfɔ́/ùfɛ́** = love
- **owó** = money
- **èbó/èbò** = vicinity
- **orí/ɔrɔ** = head
- **alé/àlù** = house (variant)
- **àkɛ́** = axe
- **ìlú** = city

### Tone Patterns:
- Tone changes depending on syntactic position
- Same root may have different tones when possessed vs. possessor
- Initial vowel may drop or change in certain contexts
- Tone sandhi rules apply in compound constructions

### Morphophonological Alternations:
The same noun can appear in different forms:
- **ìlé** (house as possessed) vs. **olé** (house as possessor)
- **elu** (stranger as possessed) vs. **èlù** (city as possessor)
- **igi** (tree as possessed) vs. **egi** (tree in compound)

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Complex tone system with sandhi rules
- Morphophonological alternations required
- Multiple forms of the same root
- Semantic interpretation needed (metaphorical meanings)
- 20 marks (standard weight)
- Fourth problem position indicates high difficulty
- Requires understanding both tonal and segmental phonology
- Subtle distinctions between similar words
