## Problem Description

Lakhota words with English translations showing ideophonic/descriptive vocabulary with systematic morphological patterns.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Match the following words with their translations given in misarranged order (5 words)
- **Assignment 2**: Translate into Lakota (5 descriptions)
- **Assignment 3**: Explain the meaning of the word ži

## Notes

- **x** is pronounced similarly to English h as in "hard"
- **ǧ** is the voiced correlate of x
- **š** and **ž** are pronounced similarly to "sh" in "shoe" and "s" in "pleasure"
- **k'** and **p^h** signify specific Lakhota consonants
- **ȟ**, **i̧**, **ŋ** signify specific Lakhota vowels

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Ideophone System**: Words that iconically represent states and qualities
2. **Morphological Composition**: How roots combine with affixes systematically
3. **Semantic Features**: Binary oppositions (hard/soft, permanent/temporary, etc.)
4. **Pattern Extraction**: Identifying morphemes and their meanings

## Key Patterns

### Semantic Oppositions:
From given data:

**Texture/Consistency**:
- **-ža** vs. **-ǧa**: temporary bruise/curl vs. permanent shrunk/hard state
- **-ža**: reversible (badly bruised, curled but smoothable)
- **-ǧa**: permanent (shrunk permanently, hard and immovable)

**Visual Patterns**:
- **žata**: forks into two parts
- **gˀleža**: ruled (vertical lines |||)
- **gˀleǧa**: striped (horizontal/crossed lines +++
- Pattern suggests systematic iconicity

**Sound/Tone**:
- **kíza**: single high-pitched tone
- **kíža**: blending high-pitched tone (trill)

**Liquid Consistency**:
- **šli**: thick liquid being squeezed out
- (Assignment asks for: thin liquid being squeezed out)

**Colors**:
- **ǧi**: brown
- **zi**: yellow
- **ži**: (Assignment 3 - to be explained)

### Morphological Elements:
- Roots encode basic quality
- Suffixes modify along semantic dimensions (permanent/temporary, degree, etc.)
- Possible prefixes for action vs. state
- Systematic iconicity in sound symbolism

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Ideophone systems unfamiliar to most learners
- Requires semantic feature analysis
- Multiple interacting dimensions (texture, permanence, intensity)
- 10 points suggests moderate difficulty
- Pattern-based but semantically complex
- Assignment 3 requires meta-analysis of the system
- Native American language unfamiliar to most students
