## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Person-Number Agreement**: Verb forms mark subject and object person/number
2. **Negation**: How negation is encoded (kêt marker)
3. **Pronominal System**: 1st person, 2nd person (singular and plural)
4. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Some forms may be ambiguous for person/number

## Key Patterns

### Person-Number Markers:
From the given data:
- Verbs show person/number of both subject and object
- Negation marker: **kêt**
- Person markers must be identified from paradigm

### Expected Patterns:
- 1sg, 2sg, 1pl, 2pl distinctions
- Subject and object marking on verb
- Verbs: dancing, decorating, swimming, devouring
- Regular paradigmatic structure

### Ambiguity:
Assignment 1 mentions "if you believe that some sentences have several translations" - suggests some forms may be ambiguous for person or number without context.

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner

**Reasoning**:
- Lowest point value (10 points) in IOL 2004
- Limited vocabulary (4 verbs, person markers, negation)
- Clear paradigmatic structure
- Straightforward pattern recognition
- Good introduction to morphological agreement
- First problem - designed to be accessible
