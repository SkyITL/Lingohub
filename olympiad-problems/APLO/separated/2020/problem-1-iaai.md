## Problem Description

Two speakers of Iaai (50-year-old male and 12-year-old male) provide phrases with English translations in random order.

- (a) Determine correct correspondences for each speaker
- (b) Translate phrases into English with non-literal meanings
- (c) Translate into Iaai in all possible ways

- A **yam** is a starchy vegetable
- **Coke** is a carbonated beverage
- Aiawa and Kua are names of people

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Age-Grading**: Possession marking varies by speaker age
2. **Alienable vs. Inalienable Possession**: Different constructions for different types of possession
3. **Sociolinguistic Variation**: Language changes across generations
4. **Possessive Systems**: Complex possessive constructions

## Key Patterns

### Age-Based Variation:
- Older speaker (50 years) uses different possessive forms than younger speaker (12 years)
- This reflects historical language change in progress

### Possession Types:
- **Inalienable**: Body parts, kinship terms (cannot be separated from possessor)
- **Alienable**: Objects, things that can be owned and transferred

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Age-grading adds unique sociolinguistic dimension
- Need to identify patterns separately for each speaker
- Alienable/inalienable distinction requires careful analysis
- Cultural knowledge about possession types helpful
