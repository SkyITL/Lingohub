## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Voice/Focus System**: Philippine-type alignment system
2. **Agent vs. Patient Focus**: Different verbal forms based on focus
3. **Transitivity**: Understanding which arguments are focused
4. **Complex Verb Morphology**: Multiple prefixes, infixes, and suffixes

## Key Patterns

### Voice Types:
- **Agent Focus (AF)**: Agent is the grammatical subject/focus
- **Patient Focus (PF)**: Patient is the grammatical subject/focus
- Different verb morphology for each voice

### Verb Morphology:
- Prefixes: 'i-, o-, ma-, etc.
- Infixes: -in-, -el-, etc.
- Suffixes: person/number agreement
- Complex combinations encode voice, aspect, and agreement

### Focus Marking:
- Voice system determines which argument is privileged
- Passive-like constructions for patient focus
- Active-like for agent focus
- Important for Austronesian languages

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate-Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Voice systems unfamiliar to most learners
- Complex verb morphology with multiple affixes
- Need to distinguish agent vs. patient focus
- Philippine-type systems conceptually challenging
- Multiple interacting morphological processes
