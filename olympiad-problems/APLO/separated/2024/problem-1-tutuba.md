## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Possessive Systems**: Understanding how different types of possession are marked
2. **Noun Classes**: Recognizing that certain animals (pigs) are treated grammatically as objects/property
3. **Cultural Context**: The cultural significance of pigs in Vanuatu societies
4. **Agreement Patterns**: How possessive markers agree with person/number

## Key Patterns to Discover

- Possessive marking varies depending on the type of possessed item
- Pigs are treated as inanimate objects (property) rather than animate beings
- Person/number distinctions in possessive markers
- Inclusive vs. exclusive first person plural

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple interacting patterns (possession + noun classes)
- Cultural knowledge provides a key insight
- Requires systematic paradigm building
- Some ambiguity in determining possessive patterns
