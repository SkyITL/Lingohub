## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Diminutive/Augmentative System**: Understanding prefix system with size/quality modifications
2. **Compounding**: Recognizing how words combine to create new meanings
3. **Semantic Composition**: Deducing meanings from component parts
4. **Polysemy**: Understanding that morphemes can have multiple related meanings

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Prefix System:
- **ǂit-**: Small, young, weak (diminutive/negative quality)
  - ǂitǂiǂni = American eagle (literally: "small eagle" - white head like bald)
  - ǂitǂmaḱqa·ni = it is weak

- **san(i)-**: Large, white, good (augmentative/positive quality)
  - sanǂa = token (bone piece)
  - saniǂwi·ni = Piegans (people of the snow/white)
  - saniǂmiyit = sky

- **suk(i)-**: Bad, negative quality
  - sukiǂmiyitni = it is blind (bad eyes)

- **kam-**: Short
  - kamnuqǂuqatnana = someone's short tail

### Root Words:
- **ǂu**: deer, white-tailed deer
- **ǂaḿnam**: bone
- **ǂmiyit**: weather/eye/light-related
- **ǂwi·nam**: snow/white
- **nuqǂuǂaḿ**: angry
- **wum**: strong/belly
- **ǂa**: heart / (possessive marker?)
- **qatnana(nam)**: stomach/belly/tail
- **maḱ**: sunny/light
- **maḱnana**: head

### Possessive Construction:
- **-nana** suffix: "someone's X" (possessive)
  - maḱnana = someone's head
  - qatnananam = stomach (someone's belly)

### Polysemy of ǂa:
Based on the data, **ǂa** can mean:
1. **heart** (as a noun)
2. **the** or possessive/article marker (grammatical function)

### Compounding Patterns:
- **qatwumǂa** = dress = "belly-cover" or "body-clothing"
- **ǂaǂitǂu** = spring = "the young/weak (season)" or "time of renewal"

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple interacting prefix patterns (diminutive, augmentative, quality modifiers)
- Need to identify semantic patterns from limited data
- Polysemy of ǂa requires careful analysis
- Compounding requires understanding of metaphorical extensions
- Random ordering adds complexity but is manageable
- No explanation required makes it quicker but demands accuracy
