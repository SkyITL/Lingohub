## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Complex Locative System**: Multiple locative cases indicating different types of locations
2. **Habitual Aspect**: Distinguishing habitual/usual actions from simple location
3. **Number Marking**: Singular vs. plural on nouns
4. **Possessive Constructions**: Understanding genitive relationships
5. **Question Formation**: Yes/no questions with specific markers

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Locative Cases:
Different suffixes indicate different types of location relationships:

- **-no**: IN (inside, contained within)
  - babamano = in the jungle (usual location)
  - leno = in the jungle
  - leino = in the house (plural subject)
  - lenokho = in there (plural question)

- **-kha**: AT/IN (general location, also habitual)
  - khalakha = in the house
  - babamakha = in the tree house (habitual)
  - leileimakha = usually there (habitual question)

- **-ye/-e**: ON (on top of, surface contact)
  - namiyaye = on my birds
  - khenareye = his father's
  - bakha/e bakha = in the water

- **-khe**: THERE (existential location)
  - leikhe = is there
  - lekhe = is there

- **-ma**: USUALLY (habitual aspect marker)
  - leileima = is usually there
  - lelema = is there (habitual)
  - babamakha = usually in (habitual location question)

### Possessive Markers:
- **na-**: my (1sg possessive prefix)
  - nalana = my wife's
  - nare = my father
  - namomo = my uncles
  - namiyo = my child
  - nanaya = my friend's
  - naramu = my garden

- **khe-**: his/her (3sg possessive prefix)
  - khemomofa = his friends
  - khemakhü = his dog
  - khenareye = his father's
  - khela = his
  - khekhuro = his uncle

- **o/okha**: his (possessive, possibly distant/formal)
  - okha = his

- **e/elo**: (possessive genitive marker?)
  - elo khuro = my uncles

### Number Marking:
- **Singular**: Base form
  - dodo = wife, snake
  - gwari = tree, snake
  - khuro = uncle
  - makhü = dog
  - nare = father
  - miyo = child

- **Plural**: -fa, -ye suffixes
  - dodofa = wives, snakes (plural)
  - khemomofa = friends (plural)
  - afa = houses (plural)
  - namiyaye = my birds (plural)
  - namomo = uncles (plural form)
  - afa makhü = house dogs (plural)

### Verbs/Copulas:
- **lei**: is/is in (copula for location)
- **le**: is in (variant)
- **leno**: are in (plural subjects)
- **leino**: are in (plural subjects in house)
- **lenokho**: are there? (plural question)
- **leikhe**: is there? (singular question)
- **lekhe**: is there? (variant)
- **bakha**: is in? (question form with locative)
- **bano**: are on (plural subjects on something)
- **banokho**: are on? (plural question)
- **leileima**: is usually there (habitual)
- **lelema**: is there (habitual)
- **leileimakha**: is usually there? (habitual question)

### Nouns:
- dodo = wife / snake (context-dependent)
- gwari = tree
- khuro = uncle
- momo(fa) = friend(s)
- nare/are = father
- la = wife
- makhü = dog
- edolo/dolo = fruit
- khalakha = yam
- amiya = worm / house
- miyo = child / bird
- yarimo = garden / bird
- naramu = garden
- nano = (possessive form)
- khela = cucumber
- nala = (my + la = my wife?)
- khena = (his + na = his... ?)

### Question Formation:
- **-khe?**: Simple yes/no question marker
- **-kha?**: Habitual/general question marker
- **-kho?**: Plural question marker

### Ambiguity:
Some words have multiple meanings depending on context:
- **dodo**: wife OR snake
- **miyo**: child OR bird
- **yarimo**: garden OR bird
- **amiya**: house OR worm

This ambiguity is intentional and creates multiple possible translations for some sentences.

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate-Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple interacting locative cases with subtle semantic distinctions
- Habitual aspect adds complexity
- Significant lexical ambiguity (same word = different meanings)
- Complex possessive constructions
- Number agreement patterns
- Need to infer context-appropriate translations
- One sentence explicitly has multiple valid translations
- Requires careful attention to morphological details
