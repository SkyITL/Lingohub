## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Demonstrative System**: Understanding proximal (this) vs. distal (that) distinctions
2. **Gender Marking**: Recognizing masculine and feminine gender on nouns
3. **Possessive Constructions**: Complex genitive chains (X's Y's Z)
4. **Case Marking**: Different cases for subject, object, location, benefactive, and possessive
5. **Verb Agreement**: How verbs agree with subject person/number

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Demonstratives:
- **Proximal (this)**:
  - ato (masculine)
  - ewai (general)
  - ewaidaga (with definiteness marker)

- **Distal (that)**:
  - osoi (general)
  - osoidaga (with definiteness marker)
  - qeqake (general)

### Gender System:
- **Masculine nouns**: Different forms for male entities
  - buqaritawo = writer(F) (feminine)
  - buqaritao? = writer(M)? (masculine - to be determined)
  - bide = boar (male pig)

- **Feminine nouns**:
  - bidora = sow (female pig, from bide + gender marker -ra?)
  - owoidaga = woman

### Case Markers:
- **Nominative (subject)**: -∅ or basic form
  - Idabe meqebi = The hawk speaks

- **Possessive (genitive)**: aga
  - Qibiro aga qido = The tortoise's mother

- **Benefactive (for)**: -ra suffix on object
  - Bidora meraqaqabi = He bites me for the sow
  - medora = for the snake

- **Locative (in)**: -wo/-dawo
  - Murowo nasabi = He will cry in the river
  - buqaritawodawo = to/for the writer(F)
  - meqarowo = in the house

- **Possessive/belonging**: -dawo
  - Ato ewai buqaritawodawo = This mouse belongs to the writer(F)
  - naqidedawo = to my mother

### Pronouns and Possession:
- **1sg**: na- (my, me)
  - naqido = my mother
  - naqotoqoware = my son

- **2sg**: ni- (your, you)
  - niqido = your mother?

- **3sg**: -∅ or qe-/qi- (his/her)
  - qido = his/her mother
  - qotoqoware = his son
  - qide = him/his

- **1pl**: me-/meri- (us, our)
  - meriqaqabe = bites us
  - meriobobi = hits us

### Nouns:
- idabe = hawk
- murowo = river
- muro/medo = snake
- qotoqoware = son
- qido = mother
- buquro = taro
- bidora = sow
- bide = boar
- maroqo = sister
- qibiro = tortoise
- qeqake = cockatoo
- uto = fish
- peraqote = devil
- meqaro = house
- taragaro = lake
- qidodawo = mother (in possessive construction)

### Verbs:
- meqebi = speaks
- nasabi = will cry
- nesabi = will sleep
- obosabe = will hit
- meraqaqabi = bites (me, for X)
- moootebe = becomes ill
- meseebi = cuts
- naqaqasabi = will bite (me)
- merabe = cries
- noosabe = will fall
- qesabe = will cut (?)
- moobobi = hits
- meroobi = cuts

### Verb Morphology:
- Different person/number suffixes
- Tense/aspect marking (future: -sabi/-sabe)
- Benefactive incorporated into verb form

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple case markers to identify
- Complex possessive constructions with chaining
- Gender system adds layer of complexity
- Demonstrative system with multiple forms
- Need to build paradigms for pronouns, cases, and verb agreement
- Some ambiguity in forms (one sentence has two translations)
- Manageable once patterns are identified
