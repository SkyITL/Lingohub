## Problem Description

The first ten fourth powers of natural numbers (1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000) are given in Ik in arbitrary order.

### Tasks:
- (a) Determine the correct correspondence
- (b) Write in numerals (4 expressions given)
- (c) Write out in Ik: 3108
- (d) Write out the eleventh entry of the sequence in Ik

## Notes

- **ɓ**, **ɗ**, **ʝ**, **ŋ** and **tsʼ** are consonants
- **ɔ**, **ɛ** and **ɪ** are pronounced like o, e and i, respectively, but with the slightly lowered tongue
- The mark **́** denotes a high tone
- The fourth power of a number n is n⁴ = n × n × n × n

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Number System Analysis**: Understanding how Ik expresses large numbers
2. **Exponentiation Patterns**: Recognizing how fourth powers are formed
3. **Morphological Composition**: How complex numbers are built from smaller units
4. **Mathematical Regularity**: Finding systematic patterns in numeral formation

## Key Patterns

### Number Formation:
- Basic number morphemes must be identified
- Complex numbers likely formed through addition, multiplication, or both
- Fourth powers show regular mathematical progression (1⁴, 2⁴, 3⁴, etc.)

### Expected Structure:
- Morphemes for base numbers (1-10)
- Possible morphemes for powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000)
- Connective morphemes (ńda appears frequently - likely "and" or connector)
- Systematic compositional rules for building large numbers

### Mathematical Pattern:
- Sequence: 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000
- These are: 1⁴, 2⁴, 3⁴, 4⁴, 5⁴, 6⁴, 7⁴, 8⁴, 9⁴, 10⁴
- The 11th entry would be 11⁴ = 14641

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate-Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Combines linguistic and mathematical reasoning
- Large numbers require complex morphological analysis
- Fourth powers grow rapidly, testing number system limits
- Multiple morphemes must be segmented and assigned meanings
- Pattern recognition across exponential growth sequence
- Unique problem type combining mathematics and linguistics
