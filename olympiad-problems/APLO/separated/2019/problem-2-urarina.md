## Problem Description

Two family trees showing kinship relations. Sentences with verb forms that change based on the kinship relationship between speaker and listener.

### Tasks:
- Fill in 10 blanks in Urarina sentences or English translations
- Provide all possible answers for blanks 4-6

## Notes

- Punctuation is omitted in the Urarina data
- **tɕ** and **dʒ** are consonants
- Urarina people practice **bride service** and **uxorilocality** (couple lives near wife's family after marriage)
- All family members in this problem are above 15 years of age and are regarded as adults

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Kinship-Based Agreement**: Verb forms vary based on familial relationship between speaker and listener
2. **Evidentiality**: Different verb forms may encode how speaker knows information
3. **Social Deixis**: Grammar reflects social structure and family relationships
4. **Complex Person System**: Agreement goes beyond simple 1st/2nd/3rd person

## Key Patterns

### Kinship-Sensitive Grammar:
- Verb morphology changes based on speaker-listener relationship
- Different forms for same-generation vs. cross-generation interactions
- Special marking for in-law relationships
- Reflects uxorilocal social structure

### Verb Agreement System:
- Multiple affixes on verbs encoding:
  - Speaker's identity
  - Listener's identity
  - Subject and object of verb
  - Kinship relationship between participants
- Tense/aspect markers
- Evidential markers (how speaker knows information)

### Cultural Context:
- Bride service and uxorilocality affect kinship terms
- Age and generation important for verb agreement
- Adult status (15+) affects grammatical marking

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Highly unusual grammatical system rare cross-linguistically
- Kinship-based verb agreement unfamiliar to most learners
- Requires understanding complex family relationships
- Multiple interacting variables (speaker, listener, subject, object, kinship)
- Cultural knowledge about uxorilocality provides crucial clues
- Abstract sociolinguistic reasoning required
- One of most challenging APLO problems
