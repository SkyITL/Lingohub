      "content": "# Transcendental Algebra\n\n**Problem 1 (20 marks)**\n**Author:** Ksenia Giiliarova\n**Competition:** First International Olympiad in Theoretical, Mathematical and Applied Linguistics\n**Date:** 8–12 September 2003, Borovetz, Bulgaria\n\n## Background\n\nIn 1916 the Russian scholar Jacob Linzbach invented a universal writing system, which he thought should be understandable to all people, regardless of their native tongue. Linzbach called his new language 'Transcendental Algebra'.\n\n## Given Data\n\nSeveral sentences have been written in Linzbach's language and translated into English:\n\n| # | Linzbach Symbols | English Translation |\n|---|------------------|---------------------|\n| 1 | (ÄÄtÄ + tı)⇝ | The father and the brother are talking. |\n| 2 | n(> Î)tl→t | The giants are working without haste. |\n| 3 | (Ät(=ÄÄ))⇝ − ⊠ | The orphans are writing a letter. |\n| 4 | (¬nÎÎ)⇝ ¬t = Î₂ | It wasn't us who wrote about you (sg.). |\n| 5 | ⊠√~t = Å₃ | It was not by her that the letter was written. |\n| 6 | (ÄtÄtÄ)⇝∞ = ∥− | The father doesn't like the work. |\n| 7 | ((> Î) ¬∽))⊖ ¬t = ÄtÄtÄ | The wicked giant ate the parents. |\n| 8 | Å₂⁻ᵗ | She is not in a hurry. |\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Assignment 1\n**Translate into English:**\n\n9. Î₂⁻√∞\n10. (ÄÄtÄ ¬ ⇐)⇝ + t = ÄÄtÄ + ÄÄtÄ\n11. Ättl⁺tl¬⇐ ¬t\n12. ⊠√⊟ ¬t = tl⊥ − (Ä)\n\n### Assignment 2\n**Write in 'Transcendental Algebra':**\n\n13. It wasn't about them that my husband and I (*say:* I and the husband) talked.\n14. The people are working reluctantly.\n15. The good widow loves the unemployed dwarf.\n16. You (pl.) will be talked about.\n\n**Explain your solution.**\n\n---\n*This problem tests pattern recognition, logical thinking, and the ability to decipher symbolic language systems.*",

The onions are red, but what about the peppers?\n\nNow consider the following French phrases and their translations:\n\n| French | English |\n|--------|---------|\n| oignons rouges | red onions |\n| poivrons rouges | red peppers |\n| oignons et poivrons | onions and peppers |\n\n> **N.B.** You don't have to know French to answer this question, and even if you do know French, it won't be much of an advantage to you!\n\n## Tasks\n\n**1.1 (2 marks)**\nTranslate each of the following phrases into French maintaining the meanings indicated in the second column. (The French for 'cucumbers' is *concombres*.)\n\n| English | Meaning Constraint |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| a. red peppers and cucumbers | [the cucumbers are definitely not red] |\n| b. red peppers and onions | [the peppers may or may not be red] |\n\n**1.2 (2 marks)**\nA dish is described as \"Scottish beef and mushrooms\". Can you determine if these statements are true:\n\na. The beef is unambiguously Scottish.\nb. The mushrooms are unambiguously Scottish.\n\n**1.3 (1 mark)**\nTranslate the dish described in 1.2 into French, preserving any ambiguities and certainties present in the English?\n\n*(Here are the French words you need: beef = boeuf, mushrooms = champignons, Scottish = écossais.)*\n\n---\n*This problem explores syntactic ambiguity and modifier scope in English and French.*",
