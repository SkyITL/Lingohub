# Difficulty Leveling Strategy for Linguistics Olympiad Problems

This document defines the difficulty rating system for all problems in LingoHub, based on analysis of IOL, NACLO, APLO, and UKLO difficulty distributions.

## Difficulty Scale: 1-5 Stars ⭐

### Overview
Problems are rated on a **1-5 star scale** where:
- **1★** = Introductory/Beginner
- **2★** = Easy
- **3★** = Medium
- **4★** = Hard
- **5★** = Expert/Olympic

## Implementation Notes for Labeling

1. **Start with source baseline**:
   - IOL Problem 1 → Start at 1★
   - IOL Problem 4 → Start at 4★
   - NACLO → Start at 3★
   - APLO Problem 1 → Start at 2★

2. **Adjust based on characteristics**:
   - Count features, examples, rules
   - Consider time to solve
   - Check for advanced concepts

3. **Compare to calibration examples**:
   - Find similar problem
   - Use relative difficulty

4. **When in doubt**:
   - Round **down** for borderline cases
   - Better to underestimate than frustrate users
   - Can always adjust later based on solve rates

5. **Document reasoning**:
   - Use "notes" column in CSV
   - Explain why you chose that rating
   - Note any unusual features

## Target Distribution (Ideal)

For a well-balanced problem set:
- **1★**: 15-20% (welcoming entry point)
- **2★**: 30-35% (build confidence)
- **3★**: 25-30% (main challenge)
- **4★**: 15-20% (advanced practice)
- **5★**: 5-10% (aspirational goals)

Current LingoHub distribution:
- 1★: 5% (21 problems) - **Need more**
- 2★: 28% (122 problems) - Good
- 3★: 36% (154 problems) - Good
- 4★: 31% (132 problems) - Slightly high
- 5★: <1% (3 problems) - Could use more challenging problems

---

## Quality Assurance

After labeling, verify:
1. ✓ All problems in same source-year have logical progression
2. ✓ Similar problems across sources have similar ratings
3. ✓ Distribution follows target (not too many hard or too many easy)
4. ✓ 1★ problems are truly accessible to complete beginners
5. ✓ 5★ problems are genuinely Olympic-level
6. ✓ Difficulty increases smoothly (no jumps from 2★ to 5★)
