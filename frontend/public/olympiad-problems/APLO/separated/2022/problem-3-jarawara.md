## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Stress Assignment**: Understanding predictable stress patterns based on syllable structure
2. **Gender Marking**: Recognizing masculine vs. feminine verb forms
3. **Subject-Object Agreement**: How verbs encode both subject and object person/number
4. **Tense/Aspect**: Different verb forms for simple past, intentional, etc.

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Pronouns and Possessives:
- **1sg**: owa (object), oka- (possessive)
  - okatao = my son
  - okaki = my grandmother
  - okiti = my grandfather
  - okomi = my mother
  - okobi = my father

- **2sg**: tiwa, tera (different cases/genders?)
  - tikatao = your (SG) son
  - tikoto = your (SG) daughter
  - tiwa = you (SG) (subject/object)
  - tera = you (PL)

- **3pl**: mera
  - mera = them

### Nouns:
- jomee = jaguar / grandmother
- kerewe = sloth
- maki = man
- fana = woman
- siba = woman (variant)
- jifari = banana
- sami = pineapple
- bijo = spider monkey
- -tao = son
- -to = daughter

### Gender Marking on Verbs:
Verbs appear to have different forms based on the gender of the subject:

- **Masculine forms** (ending in -ro, -ri, -re, -ra):
  - katomaro = fought (MASC)
  - naro = walked (MASC)
  - neri = found (MASC)
  - owataro = grabbed (MASC)
  - karawato = waits for (MASC)
  - hijareri = spoke (MASC)
  - katomeri = fought (MASC subject)
  - hijara = spoke (MASC)
  - kijohiri = chased (MASC)
  - watehiri = grabbed (MASC)

- **Feminine forms** (ending in -ha, -he, -bo, -be, -ba, -bone):
  - nebona = intends to walk (FEM)
  - kaba = eats (FEM)
  - kabe = eats (FEM variant)
  - kabehibona = intends to eat (FEM)
  - onahabone = intends to find (FEM)
  - kakatomehibona = intends to look at (FEM)
  - kakatomahabone = intends to look at (FEM)
  - okababone = intend to eat (FEM)

- **Neutral/Other forms** (ending in -haro):
  - karawatoharo = waited for
  - hijaraharo = spoke to
  - tihi

jaraharo = spoke

### Tense/Aspect:
- **Simple past**: -ro, -ri, -ra, -re (MASC), -∅, -ha (FEM)
- **Intentional/Future** ("intends to"): -bona, -bone (FEM), ? (MASC)

### Verb Roots:
- katoma-/katome- = fight
- jaka = walk
- ne-/ona- = find
- hijara-/hihijara- = speak
- kakato

me- = look at
- ka-/kaba- = eat
- owa-/wate- = grab
- karawa- = wait for
- kijohi- = chase

### Stress Patterns:

Looking at the stressed examples:
- **okóbi keréwe kíjohíri**: o-KÓ-bi ke-RÉ-we kí-jo-HÍ-ri
- **tikóto méra kárawátoháro**: ti-KÓ-to MÉ-ra ká-ra-wá-to-HÁ-ro
- **tíwa síba onáhabóne**: TÍ-wa SÍ-ba o-ná-ha-BÓ-ne
- **méra tíhijáraháro**: MÉ-ra tí-hi-já-ra-HÁ-ro
- **bíjo ówa wátehíri**: BÍ-jo Ó-wa wá-te-HÍ-ri
- **okómi ówa kakátomáhabóne**: o-KÓ-mi Ó-wa ka-ká-to-má-ha-BÓ-ne
- **jifári okábabóne**: ji-FÁ-ri o-KÁ-ba-BÓ-ne

**Pattern**: Stress falls on **alternating syllables**, starting from either the first or second syllable, creating a rhythmic pattern. This appears to be a **quantity-insensitive** stress system with regular alternation.

**Rule hypothesis**:
- Stress falls on **odd-numbered syllables** (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) counting from left
- OR: Stress falls on **even-numbered syllables** (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.)
- The pattern seems to be: **odd syllables are stressed**

Let me verify:
- o-KÓ-bi: syllables = o, ko, bi → stress on 2nd (KÓ)
- ke-RÉ-we: syllables = ke, re, we → stress on 2nd (RÉ)
- kí-jo-HÍ-ri: syllables = ki, jo, hi, ri → stress on 1st (kí) and 3rd (HÍ)

Actually, it looks like stress alternates, with **primary stress on certain positions** and **secondary stress** creating a rhythmic pattern.

**Clearer pattern**:
- Words have **stress on every odd-numbered syllable** (1st, 3rd, 5th...)
- OR possibly **iambic** (even syllables): 2nd, 4th, 6th...

Looking more carefully at **okóbi keréwe kíjohíri**:
- okóbi = 3 syllables: o-kó-bi → stress on 2nd
- keréwe = 3 syllables: ke-ré-we → stress on 2nd
- kíjohíri = 4 syllables: kí-jo-hí-ri → stress on 1st and 3rd

This suggests: **Stress falls on alternating syllables, starting from a specific edge**.

For 3-syllable words: Stress on 2nd syllable
For 4-syllable words: Stress on 1st and 3rd syllables
For 5-syllable words: Stress on 2nd and 4th? Or 1st, 3rd, 5th?

Looking at **tikóto**: ti-kó-to → stress on 2nd
Looking at **kárawátoháro**: ká-ra-wá-to-há-ro → stress on 1st, 3rd, 5th (odd syllables!)

So the pattern appears to be: **Stress on odd-numbered syllables (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th...)**

But why does **okóbi** have stress on the 2nd syllable?

Wait, maybe the first syllable **o-** is a prefix, and stress is calculated on the root?

Actually, let me reconsider. Perhaps:
- Stress falls on **heavy syllables** preferentially
- OR there's a **trochaic** pattern (stress-unstress-stress-unstress)

Let me try **trochaic** (stress on 1st, 3rd, 5th...):
- 2-syllable words: STRESS-unstress
- 3-syllable words: STRESS-unstress-STRESS
- 4-syllable words: STRESS-unstress-STRESS-unstress
- 5-syllable words: STRESS-unstress-STRESS-unstress-STRESS
- 6-syllable words: STRESS-unstress-STRESS-unstress-STRESS-unstress

But **okóbi** (o-KÓ-bi) has stress on 2nd, which would be **iambic** for this word.

Perhaps the stress system is **right-to-left iambic**: (unSTRESS-stress) feet built from the right edge?

**okóbi**: (o-KÓ)(bi) → iambic foot, then extrametrical syllable
**keréwe**: (ke-RÉ)(we) → same pattern
**kíjohíri**: (KÍ-jo)(HÍ-ri) → two iambic feet

Actually, this makes more sense! **Iambic stress from left to right**:
- Group syllables into (weak-strong) pairs from left
- If odd number of syllables, the final syllable is unstressed or forms its own foot

Let me re-analyze with this pattern:
- **okóbi** = (o-KÓ)-bi = iamb + extra
- **keréwe** = (ke-RÉ)-we = iamb + extra
- **kíjohíri** = (KÍ-jo)(HÍ-ri) = Wait, this doesn't work...

Hmm, let me try **trochaic from the right** (right-to-left trochees):
- **okóbi** = o-(KÓ-bi) → doesn't match

OK, simplest explanation: **Alternating stress with primary stress on specific syllables based on word length**.

For the purpose of this problem, I'll assume the stress pattern is **regular and predictable**, and students need to identify it from the data.

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Requires identifying stress rules
- Gender marking on verbs adds complexity
- Need to build subject-object agreement paradigm
- Verb morphology with tense/aspect distinctions
- Straightforward once patterns are identified
- Good practice for phonological and morphological analysis
