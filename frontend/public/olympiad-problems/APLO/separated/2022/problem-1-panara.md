## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Dual Number**: Recognizing the distinction between singular, dual, and plural
2. **Subject-Object Agreement**: Understanding how verbs agree with both subject and object
3. **Verb Morphology**: Identifying tense/aspect markers and transitivity patterns
4. **Intransitive vs. Transitive**: Different patterns for verbs with and without objects

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Number System:
- **Singular**: Base noun form
  - fêsãw = bean
  - ĩkôrãkriti = watermelon
  - mõsy = corn
  - yôriti = peccary
  - prĩ = child

- **Dual**: -ra/-rã suffix
  - ĩkôrãkritira = two watermelons
  - yôritira = two peccaries
  - prĩra/prĩrã = two children
  - ĩkjẽrã = we two
  - karã = you two

- **Plural**: (to be determined from context)

### Verb Conjugation Patterns:

**Intransitive verbs** (no object):
- **jy-** prefix + state/result
  - jysy = is ripe
  - jysypiâ = has grown
  - jyrãprâ = is painted
  - jymẽkuarãpio = are warm (dual subject)
  - jykuatẽ = has fallen
  - jykua = has fallen (variant)
  - jyamẽtẽ = (to be determined)

**Transitive verbs** (with object):
- Different prefix patterns based on subject person/number
- **ri-**: 1sg subject
  - rikuakâ = I have cut

- **ka-**: 2sg subject
  - kamẽkâ = you (SG) have cut
  - kakasytõpy = you (SG) will buy
  - karimẽasa = we two will bite (wait, this doesn't match...)
  - karimẽakâ = we two will cut

- **ti-**: 3sg subject or object
  - tisysa = has bitten
  - timẽramẽasa = have bitten us two
  - katikuasa = he will bite

### Tense/Aspect Markers:
- **-tẽ**: perfective/completed action
- **-piâ**: perfective (variant)
- **-prâ**: state/result
- **-pio**: future (with dual subject?)
- **-tõpy**: future
- **-asa**: future (transitive)
- **-kâ**: perfective (transitive)

### Pronouns:
- **ĩkjẽ**: I
- **ĩkjẽrã**: we two
- **ka**: you (SG)
- **karã**: you two
- **kara**: you (PL)?
- **mara**: he

### Nouns:
- fêsãw = bean
- ĩkôrãkriti(ra) = watermelon(s)
- mõsy = corn
- prĩ(ra) = child(ren)
- nãkôwsia = orange
- kwati = inajá (coconut type)
- yôriti(ra) = peccary/peccaries
- piutĩ = rice
- kiorĩpê = genipap

### Verbs (roots):
- -sy: be ripe, grow
- -rãp: be painted
- -mẽ: be sick, bite, cut (with various prefixes)
- -kua: fall, cut
- -syt: buy
- -amẽ: (future marker variant?)

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner-Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Relatively straightforward paradigm building
- Clear dual number marking
- Systematic verb agreement patterns
- Limited ambiguity once patterns are identified
- Good entry-level problem for understanding person-number systems
- Dual number adds slight complexity beyond basic singular/plural
