Here are some words in Wayuu and their English translations:

- **weˈmia** - *our food for the trip*
- **hiˈhijou** - *your (PL) visit*

- **ˈpeːʔiraka** - *your (SG) substitute*
- **niˈpeʔe** - *his left hand*
- **ˈnuːʃu** - *his grandma*
- **taʔɯˈnɯː** - *my enemy*
- **taˈʃunuː** - *my younger sister*
- **naˈpaʔa** - *their surface*
- **nɯˈsatʃiralɯ** - *his cow*
- **waˈʃijaːʃi** - *our stepfather*
- **teʔeˈhɯ** - *my flavour*
- **noˈhujaːla** - *their debt*
- **ˈneijaːsɯ** - *their stepmother*
- **pɯˈʃoʔo** - *your (SG) knot*
- **puˈtuhuna** - *your (SG) beam*
- **teʔiˈruku** - *my meat*
- **waˈsɯla** - *our tendon*

### Task (a)
Mark the stress:

- **nemeʔerainpala** - *their laughing stock*
- **tososo** - *my lung*
- **haʔalain** - *your (PL) lie*
- **nɯmɯliala** - *his suffering*
- **hɯtouta** - *your (PL) skin*
- **waseʔeruʔu** - *our half*
- **nepihana** - *their noise*
- **pɯːliːhana** - *your (SG) necklace*
- **hɯʃeʔin** - *your (PL) cloth*
- **noːʔui** - *his tyre* / *their tyre*

### Task (b)
Below are some additional words in Wayuu:

- **pɯˈmaneː** - *your (SG) kindness*
- **wɯˈsatʃiralɯ** - *our cow*
- **heheˈrɯ** - *your (PL) chord*
- **toˈnoʔu** - *my design*

Out of the four words above, two are correct and each of the other two contains a single mistake. Correct the mistakes.

### Task (c)
Translate into English:

1. **pimia**
2. **hɯʃijaːʃi**
3. **touʃu**
4. **naʔalain**
5. **namɯliala**

One of the words 1–5 has two possible translations.

### Task (d)
Translate into Wayuu and mark the stress:

6. our substitute
7. their skin
8. his stepmother
9. my left hand
10. my necklace
11. your (PL) younger sister

## Notes

- **ʔ** represents the glottal stop; it is similar to the sound in the middle of *uh-oh*.
- **ɯ** is pronounced similar to **u**, but with spread lips.
- The mark **ˈ** shows that the following syllable is stressed.
- **SG** = singular; **PL** = plural

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Stress Patterns**: Understanding predictable stress assignment rules
2. **Possessive System**: Identifying possessive prefixes for different persons/numbers
3. **Phonological Constraints**: Recognizing how stress interacts with syllable structure
4. **Error Detection**: Finding violations of phonological rules

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Possessive Prefixes:
- **1sg**: ta-/te-/to-
  - taʔɯnɯː = my enemy
  - taʃunuː = my younger sister
  - teʔehɯ = my flavour
  - teʔiruku = my meat
  - tososo = my lung
  - tonoʔu = my design

- **2sg**: pɯ-/pu-/pi-
  - pɯʃoʔo = your (SG) knot
  - putuhuna = your (SG) beam
  - peːʔiraka = your (SG) substitute
  - pɯːliːhana = your (SG) necklace
  - pɯmaneː = your (SG) kindness
  - pimia = your (SG) food for the trip

- **3sg**: nɯ-/ni-/no-/ne-
  - nɯsatʃiralɯ = his cow
  - nipeʔe = his left hand
  - nuːʃu = his grandma
  - nohujaːla = their debt (or his?)
  - noːʔui = his tyre / their tyre
  - nɯmɯliala = his suffering

- **1pl**: wa-/we-
  - wahapkiː = our puppet
  - waʃijaːʃi = our stepfather
  - wasɯla = our tendon
  - wemia = our food for the trip
  - waseʔeruʔu = our half
  - wɯsatʃiralɯ = our cow (ERROR?)

- **2pl**: hi-/hɯ-/ha-/he-
  - hihijou = your (PL) visit
  - haʔalain = your (PL) lie
  - hɯtouta = your (PL) skin
  - hɯʃeʔin = your (PL) cloth
  - heherɯ = your (PL) chord

- **3pl**: na-/ne-/no-
  - napaʔa = their surface
  - neijaːsɯ = their stepmother
  - nepihana = their noise
  - noːʔuliwoʔu = their descendant
  - naʔalain = their lie
  - namɯliala = their suffering

### Stress Assignment Rules:

Looking at the patterns:
1. Stress tends to fall on **heavy syllables** (syllables with long vowels or closed syllables)
2. If there are multiple heavy syllables, stress falls on a specific one (likely the first or last heavy syllable)
3. If all syllables are light, stress may fall on a default position

**Patterns observed:**
- Long vowels (ː) often attract stress: **ˈnuːʃu**, **waˈhapkiː**, **ˈneijaːsɯ**
- Syllables with glottal stop (ʔ) can be heavy
- Default stress position appears to be on the **penultimate (second-to-last) syllable** when all syllables are light

**Heavy syllables**:
- CVː (long vowel): nuː, jaː, etc.
- CVʔ or CVʔV (with glottal stop): peʔe, ʔɯː, etc.
- Possibly CVC (closed syllables)

**Likely rule**:
- Stress falls on the **first heavy syllable** from the beginning
- If no heavy syllables exist, stress falls on the **penultimate syllable**

### Error Detection:
The two errors in task (b):
1. **wɯˈsatʃiralɯ** - Should probably be **waˈsatʃiralɯ** (1pl prefix should be wa-, not wɯ-)
2. **toˈnoʔu** or **heheˈrɯ** - One of these likely has a stress error

Actually, looking more carefully:
- **wɯˈsatʃiralɯ**: The prefix should be **wa-** not **wɯ-** (compare with wasɯla, waʃijaːʃi)
- **toˈnoʔu**: The stress seems wrong - should probably be **ˈtoːʔu** or similar

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Requires identifying stress rules based on syllable weight
- Possessive prefix system is systematic but has multiple allomorphs
- Need to detect errors in both morphology and phonology
- Stress rules involve understanding phonological concepts like syllable weight
- Some ambiguity in determining exact stress rules from limited data
