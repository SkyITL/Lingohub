## Problem Description

Sentences in Mee with English translations showing person-number marking, benefactive constructions, and reflexive meanings.

### Tasks:
- (a) Translate 4 Mee sentences into English
- (b) Translate 4 English sentences into Mee
- (c) Give all possible translations for 2 ambiguous Mee sentences

## Notes

- No special phonetic notes provided
- Problem includes dual number (you two, we two) in addition to singular and plural
- Benefactive marking shows "for whom" the action was performed
- Reflexive and reciprocal constructions ("each other")

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Dual Number**: Three-way singular/dual/plural distinction
2. **Benefactive Marking**: Grammatical encoding of "for whom" action is done
3. **Reflexive and Reciprocal**: Special marking for "self" and "each other"
4. **Person-Number Interaction**: Complex agreement paradigms
5. **Structural Ambiguity**: Some forms can be interpreted multiple ways

## Key Patterns

### Person-Number System:
- **Singular**: I, you(sg), he/she
- **Dual**: we two, you two, they two
- **Plural**: we, you(pl), they
- Rich morphological marking on verbs

### Benefactive Construction:
- Special morphemes indicate beneficiary of action
- "I saw you for him" - action done on behalf of someone
- Benefactive can be reflexive: "You saw us for us"

### Reflexive/Reciprocal:
- "They saved each other" - reciprocal meaning
- Reflexive benefactive: doing action for one's own benefit
- Special morphological encoding

### Negation:
- Regular negation marking (tee-)
- Interacts with tense and person marking

### Ambiguity:
- Part (c) asks for all possible translations
- Some verb forms ambiguous for person or number
- Context-dependent interpretation

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate-Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Dual number uncommon and conceptually challenging
- Benefactive marking adds layer of complexity
- Person-number paradigms require careful analysis
- Reflexive and reciprocal distinctions subtle
- Ambiguity resolution requires deep understanding
- Multiple interacting morphological processes
- Trans-New Guinean languages unfamiliar to most
