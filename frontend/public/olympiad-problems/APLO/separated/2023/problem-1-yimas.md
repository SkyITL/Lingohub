## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Complex Verb Morphology**: Understanding portmanteau morphemes encoding subject, object, and aspect
2. **Person-Number System**: Recognizing distinctions between singular, dual, and plural in both subject and object
3. **Aspect Marking**: Differentiating between perfective, negative, and proximative (almost) aspects
4. **Transitive vs. Intransitive**: Understanding which verbs take objects and how this affects verb form

## Key Patterns to Discover

### Person-Number Paradigm:
- **Dual number**: Separate forms for "two" (distinct from singular and plural)
- **Subject markers**: Different prefixes/patterns for:
  - 3sg: na-
  - 1du: kap(a)-
  - 2du: kap(wa)-, antŋ- (with aspect)
  - 3du: imp(a)-, antp- (with aspect)
  - 1pl: antk(ay)-
  - 2pl: ip(wa)-, tan(an)-, antn- (with aspect)
  - 3pl: taŋ-

### Verb Stems:
- **walk**: -kul-
- **sleep**: -payki-
- **come**: -ay-
- **go**: -(w)a-
- **cut**: -kr-
- **kill**: -(n)t-
- **buy**: -(w)ayk-

### Aspect Markers:
- **Perfective**: -(a)t (simple completion)
- **Negative**: ta-, -rum/-rm (haven't)
- **Proximative**: ant- (almost)
- Some verbs show combinations: ant- + ta- (almost + negative)

### Object Marking:
- Object person/number encoded in verb morphology
- Patterns like:
  - **-rat**: 1pl object ("us all")
  - **-krat**: 1du object ("us two")
  - **-(w)aykrm**: 2pl object ("you all")
  - **-krarum**: 2du object ("you two")

### Morpheme Order:
- General pattern: Subject - (Aspect) - Root - (Object) - Tense/Aspect
- Negative and proximative aspects interact with subject marking

### Ambiguity:
- Some forms may be ambiguous between different readings
- Need to identify which form has two possible interpretations

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Dual number adds complexity beyond typical singular/plural systems
- Complex portmanteau morphemes combine multiple grammatical categories
- Need to build paradigms across multiple dimensions (person, number, aspect, transitivity)
- Some morphological fusion makes segmentation challenging
- Relatively straightforward once paradigm is established
