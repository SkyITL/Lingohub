## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which problems should I do first?**
A: Start with Breakthrough Workout, then Model Problems 1-5.

**Q: How do I know if a problem is right for my level?**
A: If you can solve it in 20-30 minutes with some thinking, it's perfect. Too easy = <10 min. Too hard = can't make any progress in 30 min.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Spend 5-10 more minutes, then check the solution. Learn from it and try a similar problem.

**Q: Should I time myself?**
A: For practice, no. For competition prep, yes (after you've solved it untimed first).

**Q: Can I use resources while solving?**
A: For learning, yes! For competition simulation, no. Practice both ways.

**Q: How many problems should I do per week?**
A: Beginners: 2-3. Intermediate: 5-7. Advanced: 10-15.
