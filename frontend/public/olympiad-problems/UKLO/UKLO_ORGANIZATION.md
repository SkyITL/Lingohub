## How Problems Are Structured

### Typical UKLO Problem Format:

1. **Problem Statement**
   - Background information about the language
   - Data (words, sentences, translations)
   - Questions to answer

2. **Questions** (usually 3-5)
   - Pattern recognition
   - Translation tasks
   - Grammatical analysis
   - Rule formulation

3. **Solutions** (separate or combined)
   - Detailed explanations
   - Pattern analysis
   - Answers to all questions
   - Often includes: "Why this answer?"

### Problem Types:

- **Pattern Matching:** Find patterns in language data
- **Translation:** Translate new sentences using patterns
- **Grammatical Rules:** Formulate linguistic rules
- **Writing Systems:** Decode or use unfamiliar scripts
- **Comparative:** Compare related languages
- **Historical:** Reconstruct proto-languages or sound changes

## Usage Recommendations

### For Self-Study:
1. Start with **Breakthrough Workout**
2. Progress through **Model Problems**
3. Try problems by year in chronological order (easier → harder)
4. Use the **database spreadsheet** to find problems by topic

### For Teaching:
1. Use **seasonal puzzles** for engagement
2. Assign problems from **by-difficulty/** folders
3. Group problems by linguistic area using database
4. Mix easier and harder problems for differentiation

### For Competition Prep:
1. Complete all problems from one level before advancing
2. Time yourself (Round 1: 3 hours, Round 2: 4 hours)
3. Focus on your weak areas using the database
4. Review R2 problems for advanced challenge

## File Statistics
