## Problem Description

Basque expressions for days of the week and calendar dates with their unordered English translations. Some words have been left out, creating gaps to fill.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Match up the expressions with their translations and fill in the gaps
- **Assignment 2**: Translate into Basque (3 date expressions)
- **Assignment 3**: How do you think the Basque names of days of the week might be translated literally?

## Notes

- Basque is a language isolate (not proven to be related to any other language)
- Spoken by more than 500 thousand people in Basque Country and France
- Has unique calendar/temporal terminology

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Morphological Composition**: How complex temporal expressions are built
2. **Ordinal Number Formation**: Patterns in "first", "last", "nth" expressions
3. **Calendar Terminology**: Days of week, months, ordinal modifiers
4. **Compounding**: How Basque combines morphemes for dates
5. **Literal Meanings**: Etymology/composition of day names (Assignment 3)

## Key Patterns

### Temporal Expression Structure:
Expected components:
- Day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- Month names (January, February, December, etc.)
- Ordinal numbers (first, last, twenty-third, twenty-ninth, ninth, second, third)
- Possessive/genitive markers

### Morphological Elements:
- Basque day names may have transparent etymologies
- Ordinal number system (likely with suffixes)
- Genitive/possessive case marking ("of January", "of December")
- First/last markers may be distinct from regular ordinals

### Assignment 3 Hint:
Basque day names often have literal meanings that differ from Latin-based systems:
- May reference numbers, natural phenomena, or cultural practices
- Different from Romance "god names" (Moon-day, Mars-day, etc.)

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner

**Reasoning**:
- Lowest point value (15 marks) suggests introductory problem
- Limited semantic domain (calendar terms)
- Concrete, real-world vocabulary
- Pattern-based with regular morphology
- Matching task guides solution
- Assignment 3 adds cultural/etymological depth without complex analysis
- Good introduction to language isolates
