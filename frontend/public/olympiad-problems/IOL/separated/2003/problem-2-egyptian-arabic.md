## Problem Description

Arithmetic equalities written in Egyptian Arabic. All summands and sums (except the last one) are represented as fractions where neither the numerators nor the denominators are greater than 10, nor is any denominator equal to 1.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Write these equalities in figures (5 equations given)
- **Assignment 2**: Determine which equality is missing a sign (one equation incomplete)

## Notes

- The letter **š** is pronounced as English "sh"
- **x** as the "ch" in "loch"
- **ʿ** is a specific Arabic consonant
- A bar above a vowel indicates length
- Egyptian Arabic dialect is widely understood by speakers of other Arabic dialects due to Egypt's media influence

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Number Words**: Understanding Arabic number vocabulary (1-10)
2. **Fraction Formation**: How fractions are expressed (numerator + denominator)
3. **Arithmetic Expressions**: Addition of fractions in Arabic
4. **Script-to-Sound Correspondence**: Romanization of Arabic words
5. **Mathematical Verification**: Checking arithmetic correctness

## Key Patterns

### Number System:
- Arabic number words must be identified from equations
- Fractions expressed as "numerator + denominator" constructions
- Addition marked by specific morpheme(s)
- Equation equality marked by verb/particle

### Expected Structure:
- Pattern: NUMBER + CONNECTOR + NUMBER = NUMBER + CONNECTOR + NUMBER
- Fractions: NUMERATOR over DENOMINATOR
- Arithmetic operations encoded linguistically

### Vocabulary Categories:
- Cardinal numbers (1-10)
- Fraction terminology
- Mathematical operators (plus, equals)
- Possibly feminine/masculine forms of numbers

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner-Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Number systems are concrete and pattern-based
- Limited vocabulary domain (numbers 1-10)
- Arithmetic constraints help narrow possibilities
- Mathematical logic aids solution
- 25 marks (highest point value) suggests moderate complexity
- Arabic script adds difficulty but romanization provided
- Cultural knowledge of Egyptian Arabic media influence interesting context
