## Problem Description

Fourteen Latin words and their English translations are given. Linguists believe that in ancient times all these words except one contained the *dh sound (d pronounced with aspiration). Later, *dh was replaced by other sounds.

Four English words cognate to four of the Latin words are also given.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Indicate the Latin word of the above list that never contained the *dh sound. Explain your solution.
- **Assignment 2**: Consider six more Latin words. Which of these words are sure to have never contained the *dh sound? Why?

## Notes

- Latin **x** is pronounced like English x as in "ox"
- The dash over vowels (ā, ē, etc.) indicates that they are long
- *dh represents a Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stop
- English and Latin are both Indo-European languages with systematic sound correspondences

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Sound Correspondences**: Systematic patterns in how PIE sounds became Latin/English sounds
2. **Comparative Method**: Using cognates to reconstruct ancient sounds
3. **Sound Change Rules**: Understanding regular phonological changes
4. **Exception Detection**: Identifying words that don't fit the pattern

## Key Patterns

### PIE *dh Reflexes:

**In Latin**:
- *dh → f (word-initially and medially in certain positions)
- *dh → b (medially in certain positions)
- *dh → d (in certain positions)

**In English (Germanic)**:
- *dh → d (by Grimm's Law)

### Given Latin-English Cognate Pairs:
- barba "beard" ← beard (suggests *bh or *dh)
- vidua "widow" ← widow (suggests *dh)
- verbum "word" ← word (suggests *dh)
- rubrīca "red paint" ← red (suggests *dh)

### Expected Pattern:
- PIE *dh → Latin f / b / d (depending on environment)
- PIE *dh → English d
- Words without *dh will show different correspondences

### Assignment 2 Strategy:
Given new words, identify which couldn't have had *dh based on:
- Their Latin forms
- Sound correspondence patterns
- Phonological environments

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Historical linguistics requires abstract thinking
- Comparative method unfamiliar to most students
- 10 points suggests moderate difficulty
- Limited data set helps constrain possibilities
- Pattern-based once correspondences identified
- Classic IOL historical linguistics problem
- Requires understanding of systematic sound change
