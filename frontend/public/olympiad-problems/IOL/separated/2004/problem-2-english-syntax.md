## Problem Description

A translator at the Swift News agency translates article titles from English. However, some titles were ambiguous and after reading the full articles, the translator realized 3 titles needed to be reconsidered because they had multiple interpretations.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment**: Indicate which titles did not correspond to the contents of the articles after translations. Give the appropriate translations. Explain your solution.

## Notes

- **Knowledge of English is NOT NECESSARY** for the solution of the problem
- Lilliput, Blefuscu, Brobdingnag and Country of Houyhnhnms are imaginary countries featured in the writings by Jonathan Swift (1667–1745)
- This is a metalinguistic puzzle about syntactic ambiguity

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Structural Ambiguity**: Identifying syntactically ambiguous phrases
2. **Modification Patterns**: Where modifiers attach in noun phrases
3. **Syntactic Bracketing**: Understanding constituent structure
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Finding systematic ambiguity across similar structures

## Key Patterns

### Typical Ambiguity Pattern:
Titles follow the structure: **X Threatens Y**

Expected ambiguity types:
- **PP Attachment**: Does a prepositional phrase modify the subject or object?
  - Example: "Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform"
    - Reading 1: [Crisis in Lilliput] threatens tax reform
    - Reading 2: Crisis threatens [tax reform in Lilliput]

### All Titles:
1. Budget Cut Threatens Railway Modernization Project Funding
2. Cold Winter Threatens Start of Shipping Season in Small Lakes
3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak
4. New Crisis in Blefuscu Threatens Collapse of Peace Talks
5. Password Leak From Megasoft Threatens Mass Piracy
6. Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform
7. Sudden Weather Change Threatens Arrival of Reinforcements to Besieged City
8. Suspension of Talks Threatens Peace Process in Lilliput and Blefuscu
9. Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens Early Elections
10. Terrorists Activity Threatens Public Security
11. Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages

### Systematic Pattern:
The problem says "knowledge of English is NOT NECESSARY" - this means the ambiguity can be detected through structural parallelism and pattern matching, not semantic knowledge.

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Beginner-Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- 10 points (entry-level for IOL)
- No language-specific knowledge required (remarkable!)
- Pattern-based solution
- Syntactic ambiguity familiar concept
- Limited to 3 ambiguous cases out of 11
- Requires metalinguistic awareness
- Interesting because it's about English but designed for non-English speakers
