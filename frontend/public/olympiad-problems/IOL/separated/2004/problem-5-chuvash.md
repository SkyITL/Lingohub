## Problem Description

A table containing Chuvash verbs and their English translations. Some data has been left out. The table shows pairs of intransitive (inchoative/stative) and transitive (causative) verbs.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment**: Fill in the gaps. If in some cases you cannot form a Chuvash verb with certainty, indicate it. Explain your solution.

## Notes

- **ă** is pronounced as a short a
- **ĕ** is pronounced as a short e
- **ü** is pronounced similarly to English "ew" as in "stew"
- **ç** is pronounced similarly to English "c" in "cereal"
- **č** is pronounced similarly to English "ch" in "church"

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Causative Formation**: How transitive verbs are derived from intransitives
2. **Inchoative/Stative**: Intransitive verbs expressing "become/be X"
3. **Derivational Morphology**: Systematic suffixes for voice alternation
4. **Irregular Forms**: Some verbs may have unpredictable or suppletive forms
5. **Lexical Gaps**: Some logically possible forms may not exist

## Key Patterns

### Verb Pairs (Inchoative → Causative):

**Regular Patterns**:
- aman "be crippled" → amant "cripple"
- avăn "be flexible" → av "bend"
- cĕt "get lost" → cĕter "lose"
- hupăn "close (intr)" → hup? "close (tr)"
- hurăn "lie" → hur "lay"
- kaç "move" → ?kaçar "transport"
- tup "be found" → tup "find"

**Suffixes**:
- **-t**: causative suffix (amant, cĕter, vĕret, verent, vackat)
- **-ar/-er**: causative suffix (kăvakar, kuçar)
- **-ăn/-ĕn**: inchoative/stative suffix
- Some verbs use stem alternation or suppletion

**Semantic Pairs**:
- be crippled / cripple
- suffer / torment
- be flexible / bend
- get lost / lose
- reach / lead
- close (intr) / close (tr)
- lie / lay
- move / transport
- become blue / make blue
- migrate / resettle
- be trampled / trample down
- be found / find
- be revealed / reveal
- drop (intr) / drop (tr)
- be in a hurry / precipitate
- be smirched / besmirch
- be boiling / boil
- learn / teach
- be covered / cover
- enter / ?
- hide oneself / hide (something)

### Irregular/Uncertain Cases:
Some gaps may be:
- Suppletive forms (different roots)
- Lexical gaps (form doesn't exist)
- Multiple possible analyses

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Intermediate

**Reasoning**:
- Causative/inchoative alternation complex
- Multiple derivational patterns
- Requires identifying different suffixation strategies
- Some forms predictable, others not
- Problem explicitly asks to indicate uncertainty
- 10 points suggests moderate difficulty
- Turkic morphology rich and systematic
- Good introduction to voice and valency
