## Problem Description

In Lithuanian nouns the accent may move according to the number and the case of the nouns, i.e., different syllables may be accented in different forms of the same word. The pattern of accent movement is called the **accent paradigm** of the noun.

There are two types of syllables in Lithuanian:
- **Type 1 (falling intonation)**: marked **«`»**, e.g.: *iẽ*, *ù*, *dū̀*
- **Type 2 (rising intonation)**: marked **«^»**, e.g.: *uñ*, *ô*, *iê*

Within the same root or the same ending, the syllable type always remains the same. For example:
- The root *liep* always has falling intonation when accented
- The Nominative Plural ending *os* always has rising intonation

The following examples illustrate the four main types of Lithuanian accent paradigms (they look somewhat different in modern Lithuanian, but this is irrelevant for the problem):

| **Paradigm** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example | linden | hand | head | winter |
| Nom. Sg. | *líepo* | *rankô* | *galvô* | *žiemô* |
| Gen. Sg. | *líepos* | *rañkos* | *gálvôs* | *žiemôs* |
| Nom. Pl. | *líepos* | *rañkos* | *gálvos* | *žiẽmôs* |
| Acc. Pl. | *líepaNs* | *rankáNs* | *gálvaNs* | *žiemàNs* |

### Historical Background:
In the late 19th century, the great Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure studied the accent paradigms of Lithuanian nouns and came to the conclusion that at an earlier stage of the development of Lithuanian there were not four, but only **two** accent paradigms. Later, as a result of a specific rule (now known as **Saussure's Law**), the accent moved under certain conditions, and each paradigm split in two.

### Tasks:
- **Assignment 1**: Determine which accent paradigms originally belonged together.
- **Assignment 2**: Determine what the initial accent paradigms looked like.
- **Assignment 3**: Formulate Saussure's Law.

## Notes

- **ž** is a specific Lithuanian consonant
- **N** shows a specific (nasal) pronunciation of the preceding vowel

## Linguistic Insights

This problem tests:
1. **Paradigm Comparison**: Analyzing systematic patterns across inflectional forms
2. **Historical Reconstruction**: Working backwards from modern forms to earlier stages
3. **Rule Formulation**: Discovering the conditioning environment for accent shift
4. **Prosodic Analysis**: Understanding interaction between accent and syllable type

## Key Patterns

### Accent Paradigms Analysis:

**Paradigm 1 (linden):**
- Accent stays on the first syllable throughout
- All forms have falling tone on root: *líepo*, *líepos*, *líepos*, *líepaNs*

**Paradigm 2 (hand):**
- Nom. Sg.: accent on root with rising tone (*rankô*)
- Other forms: accent shifts to ending with falling tone (*rañkos*, *rankáNs*)

**Paradigm 3 (head):**
- Accent stays on root throughout
- Nom. Sg.: rising tone (*galvô*)
- Other forms: rising tone (*gálvôs*, *gálvos*, *gálvaNs*)

**Paradigm 4 (winter):**
- Nom. Sg.: accent on root with rising tone (*žiemô*)
- Gen. Sg., Nom. Pl.: accent on root (*žiemôs*, *žiẽmôs*)
- Acc. Pl.: accent shifts to ending with falling tone (*žiemàNs*)

### Saussure's Law (to be discovered):
The problem asks students to formulate the rule that caused paradigm splits. The key observation:
- Paradigms split based on syllable type (falling vs. rising)
- Accent movement is conditioned by specific environments
- Type 1 vs. Type 2 syllables behave differently

Expected groupings:
- **Paradigms 1 & 2** likely share origin (falling intonation root)
- **Paradigms 3 & 4** likely share origin (rising intonation root)

### Saussure's Law formulation (expected):
Accent moves from a Type 2 (rising) syllable to the following syllable under certain morphological conditions (likely related to case/number marking).

## Difficulty Analysis

**Level**: Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Fifth (final) problem of the contest
- Requires historical-comparative linguistic reasoning
- Abstract pattern recognition across multiple paradigms
- 20 marks (standard weight)
- Famous linguistic discovery (Saussure's Law)
- Requires formulating a phonological rule
- Multiple variables to track (accent position, tone type, morphological category)
- Historical reconstruction is advanced topic
