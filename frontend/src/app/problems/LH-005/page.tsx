Explain the difference between ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative alignment\n2. When is the ergative marker -nggu used in Dyirbal?\n3. Identify which noun is the subject and which is the object in each transitive sentence\n4. How would you say \"Father returned and saw mother\" in Dyirbal?",
